Project 1: Crazyflie Synchronized Polynomial Trajectory Formation

You must create a figure 8 path for 3 vehicles flying simultaneously. Use the two example scripts as a starting point.

1. Design polynomial trajectories.
1. You are using optical flow for navigation, so shift the coordinates for each drone to start at 0, 0.
1. Upload polynomials for each drone.
1. Takeoff
1. Tell all drones to start sequence and complete 1 figure 8 and then land.

You will work on this as a team. Practice using git to merge changes from your teammates. Merging can be tricky to learn. I recommend using a mergetool like meld to help and also re-reading the section on the pro git book on merging.

## Deliverables
1. Your script.
2. A movie, uploaded to this repository showing your swarm flying the figure 8 formation.
